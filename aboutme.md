<h2 class="post-title">About Me</h2>
<p>
I am currently a second year graduate student in physics at Caltech. Before this, I was an undergraduate student at Harvard University, where I completed my BA in Physics and Astrophysics with Honors. While at Harvard, I worked with <a href="https://faun.rc.fas.harvard.edu/nebel/dfink//">Douglas Finkbeiner</a> on probabilistic cataloging (see <a href="https://richardfeder.github.io/research">Research</a> for more information). I also worked with <a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/deisenstein/home">Daniel Eisenstein</a> on target selection for DESI's Bright Galaxy Survey (BGS) (see more <a href="https://www.desi.lbl.gov/the-desi-survey/">here</a>). My research experiences in college helped foster my interest in how statistics and computational methods can enhance the study of astronomy and cosmology. I'm originally from Great Neck, New York.

  When I am not doing research, I enjoy playing music -- I currently play sax in the Caltech Jazz Band. I also enjoy hiking and biking.
