  <h2 class="post-title">Probabilistic Cataloging</h2>
  Supervised by <a href="https://faun.rc.fas.harvard.edu/nebel/dfink//">Douglas Finkbeiner</a>, in collaboration with <a href="http://portillo.ca/">Stephen Portillo</a> and <a href="tansudaylan.com">Tansu Daylan</a>

   Cataloging is a fundamental operation in astronomy. In the case where objects (such as stars, galaxies, etc.) are well separated and and observed with high signal to noise, cataloging is a 
    fairly straightforward task. However, things get complicated in crowded fields. Below is an observation of the globular cluster <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messier_2">Messier 2</a>. When objects blend together, 
    determining their properties to percent-level precision becomes a much more daunting task. Next generation telescopes like LSST, HSC, WFIRST will have improved sensitivity to pick up faint sources, but will not have 
    sufficient angular resolution to distinguish this population of newly observed sources. This means <i>a significant fraction of future observations will suffer from blending!</i>

    Probabilistic cataloging has been proposed as a viable framework to address these problems (more info soon).

    I work with Tansu Daylan on the application of probabilistic cataloging to X-ray data, focusing specifically on 
    observations from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandra_Deep_Field_South">Chandra Deep Field - South Survey (CDF-S).</a>
    CDF-S has been observed for over 8 Ms (the longest exposure of any field taken by the Chandra X-ray telescope), and will be the deepest observation of the extragalactic
    X-ray background accessible for many years to come. The galaxies observed in CDF-S are relatively sparse compared to the stars observed optically in crowded fields. However, the photon statistics from CDF-S observations
    are highly Poisson -- ~3-5 X-ray photons is sometimes enough to "detect" a galaxy! We use PCAT in this limit to better understand the population of sub-threshold galaxies in relation to the 
    poorly understood cosmic X-ray background (CXB).
