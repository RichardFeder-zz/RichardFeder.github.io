### Adding Google Analytics to track page views

Beautiful Jekyll lets you easily add Google Analytics to all your pages. This will let you track all sorts of information about visits to your website, such as how many times each page is viewed and where (geographically) your users come from.  To add Google Analytics, simply sign up to [Google Analytics](https://www.google.com/analytics/) to obtain your Google Tracking ID, and add this tracking ID to the `google_analytics` parameter in `_config.yml`.
