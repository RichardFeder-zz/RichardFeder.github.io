	Hello! I am a second year cosmology graduate student at Caltech, where I work under the supervision of <a href="http://www.astro.caltech.edu/people/faculty/Jamie_Bock.html">Jamie Bock</a>. Prior to my
	time at Caltech I was an undergraduate student at Harvard University, where I worked with Douglas Finkbeiner and completed my BA in Physics
	and Astrophysics with Honors. 
	<br>
	My primary research interests are in cosmology. I am interested in using a range of computational and statistical methods to enhance the study of large scale structure. I also work on the Cosmic Infrared Background ExpeRiment 2 (CIBER-2), a sounding rocket payload
	designed to characterize the near-infrared (NIR) background light. This is an extension of <a href="http://ciber.caltech.edu/">CIBER</a>, which flew between 2011-2014.
