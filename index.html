	Hello! I am a fourth year physics graduate student at Caltech, where I work under the supervision of <a href="http://www.astro.caltech.edu/people/faculty/Jamie_Bock.html">Jamie Bock</a>. Prior to my
	time at Caltech I was an undergraduate student at Harvard University, where I worked with Douglas Finkbeiner and completed my BA in Physics
	and Astrophysics with Honors. 
	<br>
	My primary research interests are in observational cosmology. I am interested in developing and applying range of computational and statistical methods to enhance the study of large-scale structure.
